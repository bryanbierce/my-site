        <p class='about-par'>
          Only days away from beginning my full-time journey through Hack Reactor's javascript development program I am a passionate, and excited, software engineering student. 
        </p>
        <p class='about-par'>
          After graduating from the University of Oregon with a double major in Economics and Psychology and exploring the world of training and development I discovered a fascination with coding and the process of software engineering. When I realized that not only was it amazing fun to solve problems with code but that software offered limitless opportunity to continue to grow in new technologies and to build something every day I decided to make a change in my career. 
        </p>
        <p class='about-par'>
          In August, after several months of studying evenings and weekends, I was elated to be accepted into Hack Reactor's immersive javascript development program. Having now completed the pre-course work and relocated to Orange County, California I am taking every day as an opportunity to explore the wide world of software and eagerly awaiting November 16th.
